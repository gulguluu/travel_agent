Analyze this hotel search results screenshot and extract detailed accommodation information for the DESTINATION CITY ONLY.

CRITICAL: Only extract hotels that are actually in the destination city being searched for. If you see hotels from a different city (like Portland hotels when searching Seoul), ignore them completely.

If you see hotel results IN THE CORRECT DESTINATION, provide:
- Specific hotel names, star ratings, and guest ratings
- Prices per night and total stay costs
- Neighborhoods/districts and proximity to attractions
- Key amenities (WiFi, breakfast, parking, gym, etc.)
- Booking conditions, cancellation policies
- Any special deals or promotions

If no hotel results are visible OR if the results show hotels from the wrong city, describe what you see instead (loading page, error, search form, wrong location results, etc.).

Provide a clear, detailed response that can be used directly in a travel itinerary.
